Stages:
1. Loaded data from CSV files
2. Maked a single dataset from several CSV files
3. Dataset is inconsistent and contain mistakes, this has been fixed
4. Used pandas statistics tools to gain insights from data
5. Used matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn visualization tools to present data succinctly

Questions that have been answered:
1. Which hospital has the highest number of patients?
2. What share of the patients in the general hospital suffers from stomach-related issues? Round the result to the third decimal place.
3. What share of the patients in the sports hospital suffers from dislocation-related issues? Round the result to the third decimal place.
4. What is the difference in the median ages of the patients in the general and sports hospitals?
